## Dataset
fordgobike-tripdata Dataset 
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system.
The fordgobike-tripdata dataset has 183412 rows and 16 columns. This indiactes that there is 183412 records with 17 features each.

## Summary of Findings
In male and other_gender the age range of 50-60 has the longest trip duration except for females, this is maybe due to the amount of free time from work since they are mostly retired,so they tend to ride the bikes longer either for recreation and also for health recommendations.
My biggest surprise was that the second longest trip duration in female and male actually belongs to the 50-60 age group. I would have thought that Users with age 20-30 would have the longest duration and also males youngsters should have high durations than females which is not the case presented by the data set. My assumption is maybe the Age Group of 50-60 would ride in slower speed than 20-30 year olds and would need longer duration to reach their destinations.


## Key Insights for Presentation

It was very difficult to view the plot, I had to reduce the bin size to 150 and put a limit of 3000 on x-axis. I will change the trip duration variable to minute instead of second.
